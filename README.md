# chuck-norris-joker
an application that shows chuck norris jokes for the selected category.

The application opens with a Login page and the content displays after the user logs into the application.
I did not add a RouteGuard due to limited time so the content can be diplayed with direct url to the /home page. In addition to the this any user name and passwprd is accepted for now, I did not add an authentication to the Login page.

In the home page, a default joke with no catagory is shown to the user. From the side bar user can select a category and a random joke will be displayed on the corresponding category. The button on the top of the screen renews the joke on the corresponding category.
